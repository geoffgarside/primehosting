PrimeHosting Capistrano Recipes
===============================
A gem of recipes to facilitate easy deployment of Rails applications to [PrimeHosting][primehosting] using [Capistrano][cap].

Usage
-----
Here is an example capistrano deploy.rb file which will deploy the application `cheese` for the user `prime`. The application will be using port `11000`

    require 'primehosting'
    
    set :user, "prime"
    set :application, "cheese"
    set :repository, "git://github.com/geoffgarside/ph-cheese.git"
    
    set :deploy_via, :remote_cache
    
    set :scm, :git
    set :ssh_options, { :forward_agent => true }
    
    set :app_port, "11000"
    
    after "deploy:update_code", "database:copy_config"

once you've setup your config/deploy.rb file run `cap deploy:setup` and your deployment directories will be setup for you.

Note that by default it will deploy to

    /usr/home/:user/apps/:application

so in the above example it would be

    /usr/home/prime/apps/cheese

that the application would be deployed to. If you've setup your rails application to run from a different directory then you will need to set it by adding something like

    set :deploy_to, "/usr/home/#{user}/rails_apps/#{application}"

if you've put your applications in `rails_apps` instead of apps.
